# Avalonia Dialog Helper

You can't do just Window1.ShowDialog(this) to show a dialog in MVVM. There are workarounds, such as accessing the MainWindow with Application.Current... but this approach is not recommended when using MVVM.
This code generator assists you in creating a dialog in Avalonia (v11) with MVVM. It sumarizes the steps in the [documentation](https://docs.avaloniaui.net/docs/next/tutorials/music-store-app/opening-a-dialog#show-dialog).
Leave me a star if you will.
